It was created with <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a>, and <a href="https://mui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Material-UI</a>. The interactive calendar is powered by <a href="https://fullcalendar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullCalendar</a>.'},{question:"Where does the event data come from?",answer:'All event information is gratefully sourced from <a href="https://leekduck.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeekDuck.com</a> using a custom web scraper. The "Last Updated" time in the header shows when the data was last fetched.'},{question:"Are my custom events, saved events, and notes private?",answer:"Yes, absolutely. All your personal data, including custom events, saved event IDs, notes, filter settings, and preferences, is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage. This data is never sent to any server."},{question:"How do the date and time filters work?",answer:"The date pickers allow you to set a start and end date for the events you want to see. The 'Time of Day' slider filters events based on their start time. For example, setting the slider from 6 PM (18:00) to 11 PM (23:00) will only show events that begin within that window."},{question:'What does the "Add to Calendar" button do?',answer:"This feature downloads an <code>.ics</code> file for the specific event. You can open this file with most standard calendar applications (like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook) to add the event directly to your personal calendar."},{question:'How does the "Active Only" filter work?',answer:`When you enable the "Active Only" switch, the calendar will only display events that are currently in progress at this very moment (i.e., the current time is between the event's start and end times).`},{question:"How can I suggest a feature or report a bug?",answer:`Feedback is always welcome! Please visit the project's <a href="https://github.com/zhenga8533/pogo-calendar/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Issues page</a> to report a bug or suggest a new feature.`},{question:"Is this an official Pokémon GO app?",answer:"No, this is a free, open-source, fan-made project created to help players track events.
